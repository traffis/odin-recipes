# odin-recipes

A landing page for food recipes.

Skills Demonstrated  
For this project, I used HTML and CSS to create a landing page for recipes. I utilized hyperlinking to another webpage that consists of a recipe. In the recipe HTMLs, I used headers and ordered and unordered lists for the ingredients and instructions.

Self-Reflection  
For the most part, this project was simple. I can probably figure out how to get the unordered list bullets to be next to the text for the landing page. In the future, I can probably make this project look better.
