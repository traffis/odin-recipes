        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chef John's version of a classic Thai dish with regular basil. The sauce acts like a
            glaze as the chicken mixture cooks over high heat. The recipe works best if you chop
            or grind your own chicken and have all ingredients prepped before you start cooking.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce, or as needed</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sliced shallots</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced Thai chilies, Serrano, or other hot pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>2 cups hot cooked rice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown
                sugar together in a bowl until well blended.
            </li>

            <li>
                Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and stir fry until
                it loses its raw color, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced
                chilies. Continue cooking on high heat until some of the juices start to
                carmelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes. Add about a
                tablespoon of the sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins
                to caramelize, about 1 minute.
            </li>

            <li>
                Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed the bottom
                of the pan. Continue to cook until sauce glazes onto the meat, 1 or 2 more minutes.
                Remove from heat.
            </li>

            <li>
                Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve with rice.
            </li>
        </ol>
